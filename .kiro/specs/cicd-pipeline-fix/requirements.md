# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current CI/CD pipeline for the microservices e-commerce application fails because it attempts to build Docker images without first compiling and packaging the Maven-based services (cart, orders, ui). The pipeline needs to be enhanced to properly handle the multi-language microservices architecture, including Java/Maven services, Go services, and Node.js services, with proper build orchestration and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to successfully build all microservices regardless of their technology stack, so that I can deploy the complete application without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN it SHALL compile and package Maven-based services (cart, orders, ui) before building Docker images
2. WHEN building Java services THEN the pipeline SHALL use the correct Java version (21) and Maven configuration
3. WHEN building Go services THEN the pipeline SHALL use appropriate Go build commands
4. WHEN building Node.js services THEN the pipeline SHALL install dependencies and build the application
5. IF any service build fails THEN the pipeline SHALL provide clear error messages and stop execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to run tests for each service before building Docker images, so that only tested code gets deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Maven services THEN the pipeline SHALL run unit tests using `mvn test`
2. WHEN building Go services THEN the pipeline SHALL run Go tests using `go test`
3. WHEN building Node.js services THEN the pipeline SHALL run npm/yarn tests
4. IF any tests fail THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and report the test failures
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the pipeline SHALL proceed to Docker image building

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the pipeline to handle Maven wrapper permissions and configuration issues, so that builds don't fail due to environment setup problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Maven wrapper THEN the pipeline SHALL ensure mvnw has execute permissions
2. WHEN Maven builds fail due to missing dependencies THEN the pipeline SHALL retry with dependency resolution
3. WHEN checkstyle configuration is missing THEN the pipeline SHALL either skip checkstyle or provide default configuration
4. IF Maven settings are required THEN the pipeline SHALL use appropriate Maven settings for the CI environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to build services in the correct order considering dependencies, so that services that depend on others are built after their dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building services THEN the pipeline SHALL build independent services first (catalog, cart, orders)
2. WHEN building UI service THEN the pipeline SHALL ensure other services' OpenAPI specs are available
3. WHEN services have inter-dependencies THEN the pipeline SHALL respect the build order
4. IF dependency resolution fails THEN the pipeline SHALL provide clear error messages about missing dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the pipeline to have proper error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and fix build issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any build step fails THEN the pipeline SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN Maven builds fail THEN the pipeline SHALL capture and display Maven error logs
3. WHEN Docker builds fail THEN the pipeline SHALL show Docker build context and error details
4. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN it SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed builds
5. IF builds fail THEN the pipeline SHALL send notifications with actionable error information
